## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Aerospace Engineeing at Georgia Institute of 
Technology, where I am also pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in the School of
Computational Science and Engineering. I am a member of the [Aerospace Computational 
Engineering (ACE) lab](https://www.elizabethqian.com/research/ace-group) supervised 
under the helm of [Dr. Elizabeth Qian](https://www.elizabethqian.com/home). 

My research focuses on developing data-driven model reduction techniques for
large-scale dynamical systems, with applications in areas such as fluid
dynamics and wind turbine modeling. Leveraging my background in control theory,
I also work on creating stability-informed reduced-order models to ensure both
efficiency and reliability. My ultimate goal is to develop innovative methods
that enable faster, more cost-effective, and physically accurate simulations of
large-scale systems, paving the way for advancements in digital twins,
sim-to-real transitions, and other computational methods for real-world science and
engineering challenges.

## Research Interests

- **Model Reduction:** proper orthogonal decomposition ([POD](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Lumley-3/publication/234151059_The_Proper_Orthogonal_Decomposition_in_the_Analysis_of_Turbulent_Flows/links/00b49527bed9568871000000/The-Proper-Orthogonal-Decomposition-in-the-Analysis-of-Turbulent-Flows.pdf)), operator inference ([OpInf](https://kiwi.oden.utexas.edu/research/operator-inference))
- **Control Theory:** system stability analysis, controller synthesis, stable surrogate modeling
- **Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra:** randomized singular value decomposition (rSVD), randomized least-squares
- **Scientific Machine Learning:** physics-informed machine learning, neural operators
- **Others:** multifidelity modeling, inverse problems

## Upcoming Talks and Activities

- **[Mar. 2025]** I will be presenting my work on a streaming model reduction approach and data-driven Lyapunov function inference approach at [SIAM CSE](https://www.siam.org/conferences-events/siam-conferences/cse25/) in Fort Worth, TX.

## Recent News

- **[Oct. 2024]** I presented my work on Lyapunov function inference (LyapInf) at SIAM MDS in Atlanta, GA.
